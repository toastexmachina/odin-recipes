    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi Jjigae is a traditional Korean stew. It is warm, savory, and contains just the right amount of spiciness! Kimchi Jjigae is commonly prepared when stored kimchi has become overly ripe, making it a perfect base for a stew. However, it is a delicious dish that can be eaten all year round!</p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>Kimchi</li>
        <li>Kimchi Brine</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Gochugaru (Chili Flakes)</li>
        <li>Spam</li>
        <li>Medium Firm Tofu</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the desired amount of kimchi into bite-sized pieces. Reserve the kimchi brine for later use. Slice scallions, separating the white and green parts. If using Spam, cut it into small cubes. Cut the medium-firm tofu into cubes.</li>
        
        <li>In a pot, saut√© the white parts of the scallions in a bit of oil until fragrant. Add the cubed Spam to the pot and cook until it starts to brown.</li>

        <li>Add the chopped kimchi to the pot and cook for a few minutes. Sprinkle Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) over the mixture to your desired spice level.</li>

        <li>Pour the reserved kimchi brine into the pot to enhance the flavor. Adjust the quantity based on your taste preference.</li>

        <li>Add the cubed tofu to the pot and gently stir to combine. Allow the stew to simmer on low heat until the flavors meld together and the tofu is heated through.</li>

        <li>Garnish the Kimchi Jjigae with the green parts of the scallions. Serve hot as a comforting and flavorful stew, ideally with a bowl of steamed rice.</li>
    </ol>
